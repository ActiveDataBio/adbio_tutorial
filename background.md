##background.csv
The background.csv file is generated for you but it is not a targeted approach. It's a map of all the genes that are present in a kegg pathway for the requested organism. In most cases this is fine but you can create your own background.csv file and include it when creating a project or upload it later. This file is a simple table that maps ids from the matrix file to the ids on the kegg pathway. the id and gene are required, id is the ids from the matrix file and the gene are the kegg gene names for the kegg pathway. Other columns can be inserted into the background.
